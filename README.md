tsFramework2
============

The new tsFramework will fix some issues from the first version and brings the framework to up-to-date technologies.

The new framework will be

* requiring PHP 5.4 or higher
* using decoupled components
* using composer as dependency manager
* unit testable
* using continues integration based on Travis-CI

So the new framework is basically just a collection and combination of decoupled modules.

The following list shows all the components that the framework will need and if they are already implemented. The list
of components can be altered at any time so it is not concluding.

* [tsfw-common](https://github.com/TiMESPLiNTER/tsfw-common) - implemented
* [tsfw-session](https://github.com/TiMESPLiNTER/tsfw-session) - implemented
* tsfw-config - in progress
* tsfw-routing
* tsfw-http
* tsfw-core

There will be additional (optional) components which will be available for the framework but not needed to get it working.

* [tsfw-db](https://github.com/TiMESPLiNTER/tsfw-db) - in progress
* [tsfw-auth](https://github.com/TiMESPLiNTER/tsfw-auth) - in progress
